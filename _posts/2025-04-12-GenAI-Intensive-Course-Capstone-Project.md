So, you know that feeling when you just click "agree" on something online without actually understanding what you're signing up for? Yeah, me too. For my Gen AI Intensive Course project, I originally had a fun sports idea in mind: using Gemini to generate cool summaries of basketball or baseball games. But then came the dreaded Terms of Service of the data I wanted to use. It was packed with so much legal speak, I couldn't even figure out if my project was allowed! This moment of "legal headache" actually sparked a better idea. Instead of sports summaries, what if I used Gemini to tackle this very problem? That's how my capstone project, a Terms of Service translator into plain, easy-to-understand English (with maybe a few emojis for good measure!), came to be. It's a chance to put my Gen AI skills to practical use and hopefully make those long legal documents a little less scary.
